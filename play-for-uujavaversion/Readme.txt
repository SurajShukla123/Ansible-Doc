This ia a ansible playbook for removing unused java version fro hosts

To run the Ansible playbook on your hosts, you'll need to do the following:

1.Install Ansible: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Ansible on your machine. Ansible is available for most operating systems and can be installed using the package manager or by downloading it from the official website.

2.Set up SSH access: Ansible uses SSH to connect to the remote hosts, so you'll need to set up SSH access to the hosts. Make sure that you can log in to each host using SSH and that your SSH key is authorized.

3.Create an inventory file: You'll need to create an inventory file that lists the hosts that you want to run the playbook on. The inventory file can be a simple text file that lists the hostnames or IP addresses of the hosts, one per line. You can also group the hosts in the file and assign variables to the groups.

4.Test the connection: Once you have set up SSH access and created an inventory file, you can test the connection to the hosts using the "ansible" command. For example, you can run the following command to test the connection to all hosts in the inventory file:

ansible all -m ping
This command uses the "ping" module to check that Ansible can connect to each host.

5.Run the playbook: Once you have tested the connection, you can run the playbook using the "ansible-playbook" command. For example, if your playbook is in a file called "remove_java.yml", you can run the following command to run the playbook on all hosts in the inventory file:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt remove_java.yml
This command uses the "inventory.txt" file as the inventory and runs the "remove_java.yml" playbook on all hosts in the inventory.

That's it! Ansible will connect to each host and run the tasks in the playbook.
